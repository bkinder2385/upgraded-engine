# X-Team 006 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Trello XTeam 006 board. Members will be assigned to tasks created there. Can reassign if necessary.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* We will use our shared Bulletin Board and To Do List on Trello to track progress on
the completion of tasks.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Using GroupMe to communicate when there are issues
* Also document issues in Trello comments if issues persist or if there isn't a response within 24 hours.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* By communicating properly we can address issues when some people's schedules are busy in order to help them
* Member can do this by expressing on GroupMe that they will not be able to work on their task that week and ask if 
someone else can fill in for that time.
  * Do Not ask that person to do the whole thing for you. Give them a method or two to implement.
  * **COMMENT on your methods!** That way anyone taking over (or just reading through) knows how you intend to implement the function. 
  * **Comment any changes** you did for that person so they know where to pick back up.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
* Before starting a program, we must decide on how to organize our classes and objects.
